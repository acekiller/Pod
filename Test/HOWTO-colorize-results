1. Use vim
2. define LESS in makefile to use vim's less.sh
   (I'm using the less.sh shipped with MacVim)
3. Put the following in ~/.vim/syntax/results.vim:
      syntax match Success 'SUCCESS'
      highlight Success ctermfg=green guifg=#00ff00
      syntax match Failure 'FAILED'
      highlight Failure ctermfg=red guifg=#ff0000      
4. Put the following in ~/.vim/ftdetect/results.vim
      au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.results         setfiletype results
      
NOTES:
    1. The guifg and guibg are there just because they're there.  I haven't
       used them.
    2. The 'vim' command actually being executed by less.sh is vim 7.2 as
       shipped with Apple's Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.7).
    3. Define LESS to be 'less' to return to a black and white version.
